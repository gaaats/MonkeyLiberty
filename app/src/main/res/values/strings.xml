    <string name="gtgtgt">During planning the state budget of Ukraine the historical principle is mainly used, planning of resources is carried out on the basis of the already distributed volume. At the same time, at the end of the budget period, the evaluation use of funds is carried out ex post facto and does not affect the already approved annual budget. When planning and evaluating the level of efficiency of the use of funds, it is important to give weight to each of the criteria that must be taken into account. The list of such criteria is quite large and diverse. The use of multi-criteria analysis methods is the best way to optimize such activities. Such methods as AHP, ELECTRE, PROMETHEE, TOPSIS, SAW is used in the business across various industries, every time we need to make an analytical decision based on collected data. The application of such multi-criteria scoring methods will ensure an increase in the level of effectiveness of management decision-making in the field of planning the states defense budget. Multi-criteria decision making refers to the determination of the best alternative in the conditions where there is a larger number of, usually, mutually conflicting criteria.
